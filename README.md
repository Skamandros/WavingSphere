About
-----

Waving Sphere is a game created during the Global Game Jam 2017 at the jam site Leipzig, Germany.

The game contains small spheres which can be triggered by clicking on them. After a short duration, they emit a wave. To complete a level, the waves of all small spheres need to hit the large multi-color sphere at the same time.
